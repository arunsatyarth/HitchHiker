# HitchHiker
.Net Testing library which can automate any .Net UI App. It does not matter if the app is testable or the developers have exposed Accessibility, it can automate it.

This is different from CSRoot project(https://github.com/arunsatyarth/CSRoot) which tries to give developer access to any .Net app at runtime. CSRoot tries to drag any .Net control inside any 3rd party app and make it accessible to any outside app. It could be used for testing among many other purposes.

Hitchhiker however takes your test cases and executes it inside the address space of the target Test app so the app will have access to everything.
